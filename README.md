# Week 9 Assignment: Honeypot 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Honeypot deployed
I used mhn-honeypot-1

## Issues encountered
The only issue I encountered was an issue with installing the MHN Admin application on my Mac. The script seemed to pause 
indefinitely after accepting the ten default values, and I couldn't get it to install after multiple tries.
Therefore I had to do this assignment on my Windows desktop.
